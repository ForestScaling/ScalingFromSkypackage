\description{
A sample dataset derived from the Harvard Forest CTFS-ForestGEO Mapped Forest Plot
(HF253) and supplemented with canopy height measurements from the NEON Airborne
Observation Platform (AOP). This dataset provides tree-level information used in
the \pkg{ScalingFromSky} package for examples and testing.
}
\details{
The dataset contains a subset of the full Harvard Forest plot (see Source), including
bounding box coordinates, canopy structural attributes, and derived estimates of
diameter at breast height (DBH).

Canopy height values (\code{Max_Height}) were extracted from the NEON Canopy Height
Model (CHM) using zonal statistics applied to Harvard Forest crown segments.

Canopy diameter (\code{Diameter}) was derived from crown geometry following:
\deqn{Diameter = 0.5 \times \sqrt{Perimeter^2 - 8 \times Area}}

Diameter at breast height (\code{dbh}) was estimated from canopy height and canopy
diameter using the allometric equation implemented in \pkg{itcSegment}:
\deqn{dbh = itcSegment::dbh(H = Max\_Height, CA = Diameter)}

IDhectbest is not in the original ForestGEO data, and is instead the result of a
fishnet shapefile with 1 hectare squares overlaid on top of the original plot.
The original plot is much larger than 1 hectare.

This dataset is intended for demonstration and testing purposes within the
\pkg{ScalingFromSky} package. It includes only a subset of the original Harvard Forest
dataset and should not be used as a replacement for the full CTFS-ForestGEO plot data.
